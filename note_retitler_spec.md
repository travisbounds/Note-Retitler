# Note Retitler Script Spec Sheet
- use only python
- use as few libraries as possible
- annotate code to explain what it does
- create a readme.md
- allow script to either be targeting a path or run in current path using flags
- include error handling and logging
- dont use unecesary methods like models or multiple files or too much abstraction
- the objective of the script is to retitle apps with a different format of date
- the current date possibilities are
	- 2-3 digit numeric only represented as MD or MDD
	- 4-5 digit  numeric only titles represented as MDYY or MDDYY
- output should be to change dates to YYYY-MM-DD
- the current year is 2025
- all notes were made in 2025 and should be titled as such
- all work should be recorded in release_notes.md
- all agent directives or learned behaviors or priciples should be added in a next section to this file
- all work should be done in logical branches
- never work in main
- if there is no git repo create a private one at github.com/travisbounds
- ensure that you are in a properly named directory with only this file before creating a repo. Any deviatiotions from that should be approve by me
- make the initial commit this file only
- Always start every session working by reviewing this file, release_notes.md making sure it is up to date, and a third file named memory.md
- record any working thoughts, ideas, concerns, in progress things, open tasks, etc or anything you need to capture to remind yourself of for the next session
- do not be sycophantic
- please review and improve this document, removing nothing from it ever
- the script should create a log file of its output each time it is run, ask to confirm if the log file should be saved on the terminal before running
- print the progress to the terminal as well
- use invoke to manage the tasks, flags, and command line interface
